// In switch statements, you can jump to various cases based on your expression
syntax 
  switch(expression){
    // cases
case1:
//do somethings 
    break;
case2:
//do something
break;
  default:
    // do something
}

notes:-
    1. cases have to be the same type as expressions and must be a constant or literal
    2. duplicate case values are not allowed
    3. Break is used to terminate the sequence 
    4. If the break is not used, it will continue to the next case
    5. Default will execute when none of the above does
    6. If the default is not at the end, put a break after it.
